i. Overview of the Application (i.e. What are the controls? Why this design?)

The visualizer consists of two main components, Control Panel and the Scene itself.

The control panel can be toggled with spacebar, and it showcases all the user controls on the far right. Users are able to change the 
frame of the scene, the particles "look" in scene and the particle wind speeds. 

The scene itself can be customized to look like a poem, love letter, storybook or stage setting, hence why users are able to choose the frame, and particles they desire to create the aesthetic they would like.

The scene goes through daytime-nighttime cycle, following the progression of the song. The particles react to volume levels, where highest volume (climax and beat drops) results in lots of particles generation, and areas where it's quieter results in minimal particle generation. 

When there's minimal particles, the sun and moon appear, reacting to singers voice frequency. These areas are mainly passive, but users are able to change the frame during this period, to create their desired aesthetic for the story progression.

When there's lots of particles, users are able to cycle through different particle images and experiment with wind speeds. 
Continously clicking the up key, results in a collage of particles flowing downwards, as opposed to a singular particle-type falling down. 

The different stars react to different instrument frequencies. The white stars react to synthesizer while the yellow stars react to bells frequency. The blue stars simply amplify the effect of the snapping at the end of the song, but they react to the bell frequency as well (only visually there to amplify snapping effect and indicate ending of the song)
